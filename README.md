# Java-Assignment-Ordered-Linked-List
In this programming exercise you are going to design, implement and test anordered linkedlistbased on the generic List class introduced in the notes. The purpose of this exercise is tounderstand  in  detail  the  use  of  inheritance  through  generic  methods  that  are  provided  insuperclasses and can be used in diverse subclasses, resulting in reusability and extensibility. Inthis specific case, genericfind,insertandremovemethods will be added to class OrderedList(demonstrating  reusability)  and  then  could  be  used  by  specific  subclasses,  e.g.  IntegerList,StringList, etc., by introducing type-specificcomparemethods (demonstrating extensibility).
